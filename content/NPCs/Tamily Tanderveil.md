Owner of the Otari Fishery. Used to be an adventurer.

Tamily recruited the original group ([[Fizzlewick]], [[Is]], [[Marco]] and [[Zarucket]]) to deal with a problem in her basement, which turned out to be kobolds. As part of their reward, Tamily gave them the deed to an old fishing camp on the condition they clear out any dangers there. Later, she sent [[Morg]], [[Portia]] and [[Una-med]] to join the adventurers after Is was forced to depart.

Soon afterward, she was kidnapped by [[Viggic]]. Before the party could reach her, she was taken to the [[First World]] by a contract devil in the employ of [[Tholros]].
